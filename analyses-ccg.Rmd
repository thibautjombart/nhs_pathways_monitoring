```


Using the new algorithm ASMODEE (**A**utomatic **S**election of **M**odels and
**O**utlier **D**etection for **E**pidemics) we monitor changes in potential
COVID-19 cases reported through the [NHS
pathways](https://digital.nhs.uk/dashboards/nhs-pathways), including calls to
111, 999, and 111-online. These analyses are broken down by Clinical
Commissioning Groups [(CCG)](https://www.england.nhs.uk/ccgs/). Only the last 6
weeks of data are used. The last week of data is not used to define the temporal
trend so that recent outliers can be detected.

**Note**: this research has not been peer-reviewed yet. This website is still
experimental. Please contact the <a

* Gaussian GLM and Negative Binomial GLMs
* With the following effects
    + constant, linear, or log-linear time effect
    + optional: weekend effect (weekend / monday / other
      day, or weekday effect
	  )
    + optional: with a change in slope at a given day, from day 9 to day 25
	
Analyses are run separately for each CCG.

potential COVID-19 cases.

### CCGs with number of ASMODEE outlier days and growth rate

Selecting the outlier radial will display the number of days each CCG is outlying
the ASMODEE predictions for, the growth rate radial displays the CCG growth rate. 
Selecting the CCG of interest will present the ASMODEE plot for that CCG

The growth rate (*r*) can be roughly interepreted as the percentage of daily
increase / decrease in case incidence. For instance, a *r* of 0.015 means
incidence increases by 1.5% every day, while a value of -0.02 means incidence
decreases by approximately 2% every day. See this excellent
[article](https://plus.maths.org/content/epidemic-growth-rate) for more
information on *r* and its relationship with the reproduction number, *R*.

A spatially lagged growth rate is produced from a direct neighbour spatial weights matrix based on shared land borders between CCGs.

### Heterogeneity of reported cases at CCG level

The following graph reports the daily heterogeneity among CCGs measured as the [GINI coefficient](https://www.statsdirect.com/help/default.htm#nonparametric_methods/gini.htm). Values closer to 1 indicate inequality among the distribution of cases across CCGs. The error bars represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals.

```{r}
ccg_by_date <- counts_ccg_all %>%
  select(date_index, ccg_name, count) %>%
  split(f = as.factor(.$date_index)) # Data from same time period used in the ASMODEE is split by day

GINI <- list()
for(i in 1:length(ccg_by_date)) {
  GINI[[i]] <- Gini(ccg_by_date[[i]]$count, conf.level = 0.95, R = 1000)
} # A for loop is performed on these list objects to return a GINI coefficient with bootstrapped confidence intervals
names(GINI) <- names(ccg_by_date) # the date is appended as a name

bind_rows(GINI, .id = "type") %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(type)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = gini)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lwr.ci, ymax = upr.ci)) +

### CCG by numbers of outliers

The following graph shows ASMODEE results ordered by decreasing amounts of
outliers in the last 7 days.

```{r plots_all, eval = TRUE, fig.height = 2 * round(n_figs / 3), out.width = "100%", dpi = 50} 
# plot results for top ccg
plot(res_ccg_all, ncol = 3)

```

### Table summary for all CCGs

This table summarises the numbers of changes detected by ASMODEE over the last 7
days, broken down into increases and decreases. *prob* is the probability of
observing that many outliers in the last week under the best fitting model,
given the chosen alpha threshold (5%).

```{r ccg_all_table, results = "markup"}

# display table
ccg_all_stats %>%
  mutate(prob = format.pval(p_recent_outliers, digits = 3),
         ccg = gsub("_", " ", ccg),
         ccg = gsub("nhs", "NHS", ccg)) %>%
  select(ccg,
         changes = n_recent_outliers,
         increase = n_recent_increases,
         decrease = n_recent_decreases,
         prob) %>%
